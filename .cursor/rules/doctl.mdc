## Install `doctl` CLI

In Ubuntu: `sudo snap install doctl`

## Get an API token

From the Digital Ocean applications page, select "API" from the left menu. Generate an API key with the read and write permissions you want. Copy the API key to your clipboard, as you will need it in the next step.

## Authenticate the CLI

To create an auth context in the CLI:

```bash
export CONTEXT_NAME="your-auth-context-name"
doctl auth init --context $CONTEXT_NAME
# Enter your API key when prompted
```

Then, to select the auth context you created:

```bash
doctl auth switch --context $CONTEXT_NAME
```

## Create a project

If you haven't created a project yet, you can create one with `doctl`:

```bash
export PROJECT_NAME="your-project-name"
export PROJECT_PURPOSE="your project description"
doctl projects create --name $PROJECT_NAME --purpose $PROJECT_PURPOSE --environment "Production"
```

## Create a managed PostgreSQL serverless database

```bash
export DATABASE_NAME="db-name"
doctl databases create $DATABASE_NAME --engine pg --version 17 --size db-s-1vcpu-1gb --num-nodes 1 --wait
```

This will print a database ID and connection URL to the console. To get connection details in a friendlier format, use:

```bash
export DATABASE_ID="id-printed-after-database-create-step"
doctl databases connection $DATABASE_ID --format Host,Port,User,Password,Database
```

## Assign the database to your project

```bash
export PROJECT_ID="id-printed-after-project-create-step"
doctl projects resources assign $PROJECT_ID --resource=do:dbaas:$DATABASE_ID
```

## Set up a firewall rule (optional)

Note that by default your database is publicly accessible from the Internet, so ideally you should create a firewall rule to restrict access to only your application's IP address once you have deployed the application. The command to do this is:

```bash
doctl databases firewalls append <database-cluster-id> --rule <type>:<value>
```

where <type> is ip_addr and <value> is the IP address of the application server. See the DigitalOcean documentation for more details.

Note: You can only complete this step after you have deployed your application layer and obtained a static IP address for the application server.
