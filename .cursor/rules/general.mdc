The project uses `uv` for package management. Add dependencies with `uv add`, and never use conditional import patterns.

This is a statically typed Python project. Accordingly, attributes should always be accessed directly, never through `getattr()`.

We mostly want to make sure the code fails fast and/or actually works correctly rather than wrapping everything in half-assed fallbacks.
